# vifi.health — marketing site

Single-page static site for [ViFi](https://github.com/Zpopowitz/vifi-ml). Built with Astro + Tailwind. Hosted on Vercel. Deployed at **vifi.health**.

The engineering project lives in the sibling repo [`vifi-ml`](https://github.com/Zpopowitz/vifi-ml). This repo is marketing-only.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
```

```bash
npm run build        # static output → dist/
npm run preview      # serve dist/ locally
```

Node 22+, npm 10+.

## Deploy

Pushed to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys to production. There is no separate staging environment for now (preview deploys cover it).

### First-time Vercel + Cloudflare DNS setup

1. **Vercel**: Add new project → import this repo → framework preset: **Astro** (auto-detected) → Deploy. Default settings are correct.
2. **Vercel domain**: Project → Settings → Domains → Add `vifi.health` and `www.vifi.health`.
3. **Cloudflare DNS**: For each domain Vercel asks for, copy the `A` / `CNAME` record into Cloudflare DNS:
   - Apex `vifi.health` → `A` record to `76.76.21.21` (Vercel's anycast IP — confirm exact value Vercel shows)
   - `www.vifi.health` → `CNAME` to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. **Cloudflare proxy**: Set the proxy status to **DNS only** (gray cloud) — Vercel handles its own TLS, double-proxying breaks redirects.
5. **TLS**: Wait ~1 minute, Vercel provisions a Let's Encrypt cert. Confirm `https://vifi.health` resolves and the padlock is clean.

## Editing copy

All page content lives in `src/pages/index.astro`. The constants at the top of the file (headline numbers, GitHub URL, contact emails) are the things most likely to change as the project evolves — keep them at the top so casual edits don't require navigating the markup.

Regulatory framing is intentional throughout. Before changing anything in the **What we're building**, **For hospitals**, or **Footer** sections, read [the FDA's guidance on labeling for unapproved devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/device-labeling). The current copy is conservative on purpose.

Phrases that are safe today:

- "Pre-clearance research prototype, not a medical device"
- "Building an FDA 510(k)-track contactless monitor"
- "Wellness-grade pilot, parallel to existing standard-of-care monitoring"

Phrases to **avoid**:

- "FDA-approved" / "FDA-cleared" (false until it actually is)
- "Monitors patient vitals" in present tense (implies clinical use)
- Any patient outcome claim (mortality, length of stay, etc.) without a published study

## Branch naming

Trunk-based off `main`, same convention as `vifi-ml`:

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | New sections, components, integrations |
| `fix/`  | Bugs, broken links, copy errors |
| `chore/`| Refactors, deps, tooling |
| `docs/` | This README, CONTRIBUTING |
| `exp/`  | Design experiments / spikes |

Squash-merge to `main`, delete the branch.
